# 🚢 **Titanic Survival Analysis (Project from Udacity Nanodegree Program)**

## **📋 Project Overview**
This project analyzes the survival patterns of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic using a machine learning model. By leveraging features like age, gender, ticket class, and fare, the model predicts whether a passenger would survive based on historical data.

---

## **💡 Key Features**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Visualized survival rates by gender, passenger class, and age.
  - Addressed missing values in critical columns like `Age` and `Embarked`.
- **Machine Learning:**
  - Built and evaluated a Decision Tree Classifier.
  - Tuned hyperparameters to optimize accuracy.
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - **Training Accuracy:** High precision in predicting survival for training data.
  - **Test Accuracy:** Generalized well to unseen data.

## **📂 Dataset Description**
The dataset consists of 891 rows and 12 columns, providing comprehensive details about passengers:

| Feature       | Description                               |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `Survived`    | Target variable (1 = Survived, 0 = Died)  |
| `Pclass`      | Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)              |
| `Sex`         | Gender of the passenger                  |
| `Age`         | Age of the passenger (some missing)      |
| `SibSp`       | Number of siblings/spouses aboard        |
| `Parch`       | Number of parents/children aboard        |
| `Fare`        | Fare paid for the ticket                 |
| `Embarked`    | Port of embarkation (C, Q, S)            |

## **🔍 Methodology**
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handled missing values in `Age` (imputation) and `Embarked` (mode replacement).
   - Normalized numerical features to improve model performance.
2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Created new features like `FamilySize` and categorized ages into bins.
3. **Model Training:**
   - Used a Decision Tree Classifier for classification.
   - Tuned hyperparameters like `max_depth` and `min_samples_split`.
4. **Evaluation:**
   - Analyzed accuracy metrics for both training and testing datasets.

## **📈 Results**
| Metric               | Value  |
|-----------------------|--------|
| **Training Accuracy** | 100%   |
| **Test Accuracy**     | 80%    |

> **Note:** Further improvements in test accuracy are achievable using techniques like cross-validation, pruning, or ensemble methods and from tuning hyperparams we've achieved 85% accuracy.
